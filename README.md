## :computer:Description

Out of the Woods is a forest simulator inspired by the Slenderman video game. In this game, players find themselves immersed in a dark and eerie woodland environment where the objective is to avoid encountering Slenderman, a nightmarish entity lurking within the woods. The game's development served as a platform to explore the integration of technologies like OpenGL with Python.
